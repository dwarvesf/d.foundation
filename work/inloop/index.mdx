[Discovery Inloop](https://discovery.inloop.studio/) is a one-week AI-powered consulting sprint format, purpose-built to help organizations break through ambiguity and move from indecision to clear direction. 

It combines the intuition and experience of facilitators with structured AI interactions, delivered through a secure and scalable digital platform. Each sprint is guided by a reusable consulting playbook and fortified by cryptographic contract logging—ensuring trust and repeatability across teams, industries, and regions.

Backed by The Dwarves' engineering team, Inloop evolved from a lightweight conversational tool into a professional-grade infrastructure tailored for enterprise consulting work.

### Solution

Discovery Inloop represents a strategic evolution of conversational AI technology for enterprise consulting applications. Built on proven AI chat architecture, the platform extends foundational capabilities with enterprise-grade security and organizational frameworks.

Working with the core team's technical leadership, our developers contributed to adapting existing conversational AI infrastructure to meet the demands of consulting facilitation. The goal was to create a secure, structured platform that could support professional engagements while maintaining intuitive interaction patterns.

> Key Innovation: Implementation of a comprehensive clone and template system that allows facilitators to replicate successful engagement patterns while ensuring each interaction maintains cryptographic integrity.

The platform provides consulting professionals with enterprise-grade AI tools, establishing a foundation for secure, structured AI-assisted consulting engagements.

### How we built it

Development focused on **extending proven conversational AI capabilities** for enterprise consulting and implementing robust security frameworks. The approach built upon existing chat infrastructure while adding organizational structure and security features required for consulting applications.

#### Enhanced clone architecture

The success built upon **existing conversational AI clone capabilities**, significantly enhanced for professional consulting. The core cloning functionality was extended to support structured templates, engagement patterns, and facilitator methodologies while maintaining the intuitive interaction model.

#### Enterprise security framework

To meet professional consulting requirements, a comprehensive **security layer** was implemented featuring user action provenance tracking. This captures detailed behavioral patterns during contract signing and engagement interactions, generating **fingerprint confidence scores** that verify user identity and intent with cryptographic integrity.

#### Organizational hierarchy

Building on existing conversation infrastructure, a **structured organizational framework** was created supporting the consulting workflow. This hierarchy allows facilitators to manage multiple engagements while maintaining clear boundaries and security controls.

#### Tamper-proof contract system
Recognizing the need for verifiable agreements in consulting contexts, **tamper-proof contract capabilities** were developed that bind both facilitators and engagements with cryptographic verification. The system tracks detailed behavioral patterns during contract signing, providing mathematical verification of signatory identity and intent.

#### Technical approach

- **Conversational AI foundation:** Built upon **proven chat infrastructure** with enhanced capabilities
- **Advanced clone system:** Extended existing functionality to support **consulting templates and patterns**
- **Cryptographic security:** Implemented **fingerprint verification and device binding** for enterprise-grade security
- **Organizational structure:** Created hierarchical framework supporting consulting workflow
- **Contract integrity:** Developed **tamper-proof contract system** ensuring accountability
- **Enterprise adaptation:** Professional-grade enhancement specifically designed for consulting applications

#### Lean development process

To deliver the platform efficiently:

- **Core team collaboration:** Direct partnership with lead facilitators and domain experts
- **Rapid iteration:** Daily standups and async feedback loops accelerated decision-making
- **Real-time refinement:** Feedback incorporated immediately to fine-tune workflows
- **Unified approach:** Technical and product teams operated as one unit

### How we collaborated
Our developers worked closely with the **core team's technical leadership** and consulting professionals to adapt proven conversational AI technology for enterprise consulting applications. The collaboration brought together engineers experienced in conversational AI platforms, expertise in enterprise security frameworks, and consulting methodology specialists.
