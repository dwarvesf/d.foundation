      years, we observe the tech industry and pick out the most promising tech
      to put into the radar to begin the assessment process.
      
      This urges us to learn the newest and the best technology out there to enhance the output
      quality, speed up the development process, also to bring the best pieces
      of software to life.
      
      Everyone is encouraged to gather into small focus
      groups to discuss and study a particular topic. The below format could be
      found originated from ThoughtWorks. We organize the topics using two
      categorizing elements: **Quadrant** and **Ring**.
      
      Check out the repo <Link href="https://github.com/dwarvesf/radar" className="font-medium text-primary">
