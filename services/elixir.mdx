## Elixir & Phoenix

<ParagraphBlock>
Elixir benefits from the wealthy, open-source framework Phoenix which enables us to shorten development process and shift our focus into the product-market fit instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Power of Erlang & Elixir

<ContentBoxes
  leftColumnContent="Elixir runs on top of the Erlang VM (BEAM), inheriting Erlang’s decades-long reputation for concurrency, distribution, and reliability.
  This foundation gives Elixir apps built-in support for handling millions of connections, real-time communication, and automatic recovery from errors.
  The result: battle-tested performance in production for messaging, IoT, and high-availability services."

        <ListItem>Fault-tolerant by default (Nine-Nines uptime)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Pattern matching & functional programming</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Hot code reloading and real-time updates</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Modern, readable syntax inspired by Ruby</ListItem>

## Concurrency built-in

<ParagraphBlock>
The Erlang VM (BEAM) was built for concurrency. Its actor model helps create isolated processes that communicate via messages without interfering with each other’s state. This enables the system to handle user spikes with ease.

## Scalability

<ParagraphBlock>
Thanks to the Erlang VM, Elixir apps can run on various nodes. This makes it easy to scale web or IoT systems across servers and machines. Multiple virtualized servers over distributed systems mean better app performance.

## Reliability: fault-tolerant approach

<ParagraphBlock>
One of the features that developers love the most about Erlang and Elixir is fault-tolerance. It provides built-in safety mechanism to keep the product functioning even when something goes wrong. Processes alert a “failure” to dependent processes, even when they’re on different physical servers so they can fix the problem immediately.

  ## A growing and solid community

  <ParagraphBlock>
    Although Elixir is quite a young language, it has the time to develop an active user community where even highly qualified engineering are willing to build, help and share their knowledge. Moreover, there is a lot of resources and tutorials available for developers to their hands on Elixir.
