        {`The mobile app is a frontend for the business to communicate with customers. Mobile users tend to stick to the application that brings better experience.

        We’ve been working on mobile applications since 2013 and grokking on how each approach works underlying, thus we always recommend our clients to go with native app development.
        Native apps are applications that are written in languages specific to the operating systems that they are developed for - primarily.

        We also help architect and build mobile apps on different platforms with native technology, follow by modern design guideline. When an app closely follows the guidelines for popular platforms, users could quickly adapt and become familiar in using it.

### Deliver the best UX to end users

<ParagraphBlock>
  UX/UI is unified within a given platform, so it is already well known by users. The UX patterns recur in other native apps, so people will intuitively know how to move around in your app as well. User experience is also much better because the higher performance allows everything to run smoothly.

It is also easier for the creators to follow the imposed standards when designing and developing an app.

Simply put, creating native applications supports good UI/UX patterns for a given platform. In addition, you can develop platform-specific features directly within a native app, like integration with Google Pay or Siri.
