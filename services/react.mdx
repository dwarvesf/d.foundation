    React and JSX has became an industry-standard environment for 
    frontend development. With React we can rapidly build 
    reusable components and building blocks for complex web applications.

## TypeScript & React
TypeScript and its types system enabled us to use highly-productive development tools and practices like static checking and code refactoring. Combined with React, we get the benefits of a statically typed language for the UI - more safety and fewer bugs shipping to the frontend.

At Dwarves, we believe TypeScript is the way to go when writing a modern web or JavaScript-based application.
