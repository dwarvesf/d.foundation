### TypeScript & React

<ParagraphBlock>
TypeScript and its types system enabled us to use highly-productive development tools and practices like static checking and code refactoring. Combined with React, we get the benefits of a statically typed language for the UI - more safety and fewer bugs shipping to the frontend.

At Dwarves, we believe TypeScript is the way to go when writing a modern web or JavaScript-based application.
