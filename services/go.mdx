## Cloud-Native Language

<ParagraphBlock>
Go has emerged as the language of cloud infrastructure since 2014. By 2017, every major cloud company began implementing critical services in Go. Names like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, and Digital Ocean rely on Go for core components of their platforms.

## Simple & Effective

<ParagraphBlock>
Go’s programming syntax is quite simple and easy to learn. To be specific, C++ has more than 70 basic keywords, whereas Go has 25 keywords.

Go also utilizes strong concurrency primitives, a well-developed standard library that offers robust network tools, and a fast compiler. As a result, it is the core of many open infrastructures such as Docker, Kubernetes, Etcd, Consul, Istio and a large amount of others.

## Go at Dwarves

<ParagraphBlock>
Dwarves are Go experts as we adopted Go on our day one. From the experience of building dozens of apps with Go, we’ve learnt that it works extremely well for building specific, single-purpose types of apps—such as a download server, metrics collector or a network gateway.

With all the great benefits, we are excited and passionate about the future Go can provide to our clients. As of today, organizations, including our current clients are increasingly moving towards Go when they need cloud infrastructure solutions.
