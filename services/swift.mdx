### Built with Swift

<ParagraphBlock>
At Dwarves, we have been using Swift since the very first version of it. We leverage Swift’s features in our projects .eg Protocol Oriented Programming, Functional Reactive Programming and so on. On that journey, we have built many applications in variety of Apple’s platforms such as iOS, macOS, and App Extension.

### Faster, Safer

<ParagraphBlock>
  <ColumnsList columns={1}>
    <li>Swift is faster than Objective-C, because it removed the limitations of C language and has been improved with the help of advanced technologies that were unavailable when C was developed.</li>
    <li>Swift is compatible with binary that means the end result of Swift app development will benefit the smaller for users for running their new operating system.</li>
    <li>The launch time of your application will be fast since Swift’s dynamic library is utilized by an app and will be cached in the memory, which will be shared among the apps.</li>
    <li>Swift’s syntax and language constructions exclude the several types of mistakes potentially possible in Objective-C. This control means fewer crashes and cases of unexpected behavior.</li>

### Apple’s ongoing focus

<ParagraphBlock>
  <ColumnsList columns={1}>
    <li>Swift is backed by Apple, and it is the primary language for building any Apple’s platform application.</li>
    <li>Easy to adapt the update whenever Apple has any new rollout feature.</li>
    <li>Easy to distribute on App Store since Apple has given us a well-designed toolkit for handling this.</li>

### Low maintenance cost

<ParagraphBlock>
  <ColumnsList columns={1}>
    <li>The code in Swift more closely resembles English, making it easier to read and requiring less time to check the code.</li>
    <li>It requires less number of code lines compared to Objective-C in comparison to other apps.</li>
    <li>In Objective-C, you have to manually synchronize method names and comments between files. While with Swift, programmers can spend more time creating app logic and improving the quality of their code, comments, and features that are supported.</li>
