## Deploy & Learn

Your product is never “done”. Past features can be improved and new features can be added. Our objective is to leave you in a place where you can confidently maintain and improve your product with the right tools and knowledge to test, assess, and make the best decisions for what matters—after our engagement has been concluded.

## Engineering Culture

We introduce processes and approaches to culture shaping that lead to suitable hires and proficient people.

Hiring doesn’t stop once someone starts their first day. Retaining your talented team requires a thoughtful and ongoing effort that ultimately comes down to - are they fulfilled at work?

## Best Practices

Some of the processes and best practices which we believe would drive a healthy product:

## Mentoring

We work 1 on 1 and in small groups with junior team members who are prime to advance in their career, but lacking the senior guidance to get them there.

Using tools like pair programming, design critique, lunch and learns, and code or design audits, we are able to provide the dedicated expert mentorship that you don’t have the bandwidth for.

By investing in junior designers and developers’ growth, you can achieve higher retention rates, positively impact individuals’ careers, and become a top choice for future talent.

## Mentoring 

Finding the right designers and developers for your team takes time, as it should. You want to make sure you’re going through a meaningful interview process and making the right picks to help you long into the future.
