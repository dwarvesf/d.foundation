## Social Impact

<ParagraphBlock>
Given the network we have built through years, we bridge the gap between technical experts and IT students to work together on building tech solutions for social causes.

This enables social causes's owners to focus more on their work, technical veterans can utilize their valuable mentorship on students who prefer to gain practical experience and social awareness.

      ### Salt Cancer Initiative

      <ParagraphBlock className="text-lg">
        Salt Cancer Initiative (SCI) is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing information, education, training, and emotional support for cancer patients in Vietnam. Founded by **Thuy Thanh Truong**, a former cancer patient who has been 3 times honored for her influence and inspiration for the youth community. As a person who has gone through the hard times facing cancer, Thuy understands how struggling and fearful it was not to approach a reliable source of cancer information. And she decided to do something about it.

        We help bring the resolution using tech. In an era where electrical device and the influence of social media is really a thing, we can't help but dive in and leverage it to amend social problem in a better approachable way.

      ### Library Project

      <ParagraphBlock className="text-lg">
        It all started in 2006 when Tom Stader and his friends wanted to make a difference in the lives of orphanages and children's shelters in Dalian, China. The Library Project (TLP) donates rural elementary school libraries, conducts children's literacy programs, and provides teacher training. Throughout four key periods of the journey: A Simple Idea (2006), Finding Our Way (2007-2008), Taking Risks (2009), and One Million Books (Today), TLP tells the story of positively creating impacts to the lives of underprivileged children.
